# 100daysofPython-files
These are the files that reflect my progress on the 100 days of python Course.

[07/03/20]: I worked today on the exercise proposed in the github:
Your goal today will be to flesh out `program.py` and `api.py` to:

1. Get a search word from the user
2. Call the search service via requests
3. Verify the success of this
4. Return basic dictionaries to `program.py` and list the resulting titles

You'll be done when you see something like:

```
$ python3 program.py

******* SEARCH TALK PYTHON *******
What keywords to search for? <ENTER WORDS>
There are 7 matching episodes:
1. Past, Present, and Future of IronPython
2. Deep Dive into Modules and Packages
3. Python at Netflix
4. ...
```
Got working the program and api.
