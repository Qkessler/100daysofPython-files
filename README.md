# 100daysofPython-files
These are the files that reflect my progress on the 100 days of python course.

[03/03/20]: Starting day 1 of group of json. Understood all json work in python3. Started with [quickfs API]{https://quickfs.net "Quick FS website"}. There is a lot of problems with the documentation, it is hard to understand how does the link work, got some data of the company I'm researching.
